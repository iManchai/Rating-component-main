## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Vanilla CSS

### What I learned

It was a good exercise to practice my Javascript and CSS skills. As a beginner I had to checkout how to center a div (lmao)
and practice manipulating the DOM. Overall it was a good exercise to practice Javascript and CSS.

### Continued development

I want to keep practicing and learning about manipulating the DOM with JS, also keep practicing responsive design with CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-remove-class-from-multiple-elements) - This blog that I founded searching on how to manipulate the DOM was a really helpfull site to understand and see how to do certain things.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - W3Schools is always there to help to find certain information about CSS, Javascript or HTML. It doesn't need more explanation.
- [MDN] (https://developer.mozilla.org) - The Mozilla Developer Network is, along W3Scholls, one of the best places to search when you are trying to figure out something that you don't understand.
